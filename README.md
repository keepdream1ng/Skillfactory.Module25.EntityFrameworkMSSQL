This is a study project for Skillfactory C# developer course, a final module for working with databases.
I got to wire a MSSQL db to EF. Had db running in the docker container.

Even though task was only to write the repository methods, i felt like its a good time to get to know bogus for populating db with a fake data.
Also I set up integration tests for each repository method.
Microsoft articles say its better not to test your methods with in memory provider, so I didnt bother with setting it up for mentors check.
Sorry for that!
